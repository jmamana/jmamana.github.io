   <h1>TELL THE TRUTH</h1>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size:100%;">
<br />Saint Yared (505-571 AD) is credited with inventing the tradition of Ethiopian liturgical music. (The French label INEDIT has a collection of such recordings, Église chrétienne orthodoxe d’Éthiopie, through which I first encountered this particular genre of sacred music.) The chant is characterized by a circuitous pentatonicism sung in monophonic unison. There is often percussion. 
<br /><br />Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou undertook a study of the music of Saint Yared in the 1960s. Earlier, she’d learnt the Western canon at boarding school in Switzerland. Her education would be disrupted by Mussolini’s barbarous invasion of Ethiopia in 1936. She was imprisoned. Afterward, she fled to a monastery and lived the life of an ascet-ic. Upon returning home she began to study and compose again. It wasn’t until 1967 that she recorded any of her compositions. These recordings, famously re-released by Buda Musique in 2006 as Ethiopiques Vol. 21, evince her synthesis of the sacred music of Ethiopia and the Western classical tradition. They would also bring Guèbrou overdue acclaim in the West—though not without neocolonialist condescension. The BBC called her “the Honky Tonk Nun”. An article in The Guardian describes her music as “bluesy” and “freewheeling”. (That same article also calls her the “singing nun”, despite that her music is for solo piano.) Such descriptions are particularly odd given that, according to Israeli composer Maya Dunietz, who organized a tribute concert to Guèbrou in her adopted home of Jerusalem, “in her own eyes, [Guèbrou] sees herself as continuing the legacy of Beethoven and Schumann and Chopin and Brahms.”
<br /><br />The Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Music Foundation is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, just adjacent to my own hometown outside Washington D.C. She performed for the first time in 35 years at the Jewish Community Center in D.C. in 2008. Around that time, I would have been busy in GarageBand sampling Ethio-Jazz and Zema, as well as the work of Emahoy herself, like any good suburban boho. The colonialist over-tones of my work would certainly have been lost on a young naif like me, just as the strangeness and complexity of her story would have also been lost on an older, more radical version of me. But when I revisited to Ethiopiques Vol. 21 at 23, I found the same divinity I’d heard in sacred polyphony. The specificty of Emahoy’s work, elucidated by but not reducible to her context, conceived in exaltation of the Christian God, is, I think, a concomitant of its being overdetermined.
<br /><br />“Tell the Truth”, then, is syncretic music; but it aspires, like Emahoy’s music does, to assert the unity of miaphysticism, as opposed to the eclecticism of the Orientalist. The beat at the end is straight out of Boom Bap; the voices reared by Mauchaut; the strings lifted from Beethoven’s Heileiger Dankesang; and its harmony, from Emahoy. But the imperative at its center is univocal. It is an ethical imperative, read like a command-ment, for all and sundry:</p>
