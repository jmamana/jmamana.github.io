<p>there's no one in hollywood who could possibly play my father
so i no longer go to the movies
i don't see anymore movies at all
so i walk down streets of amber
as the old economy collapses
in the soggy sheets of The Atlantic
in the swamplike sheets of Manhattan
the critics are quiet

to the last American to call out the names of every crumbling monument: did you ask for it?

the last time i went to the movies
i kept on shouting questions 
to the characters in the movies
but these people had no answers
they had no answers at all
when they told me to be quiet
enraged i said they had nothing 
but the celluloid they depend on
they told me it's in digital
and that TV is better anyway

to the last American to call out the names of every crumbling monument: did you ask for it?</p>
