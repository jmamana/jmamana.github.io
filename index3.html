<p>there's no one in hollywood who could possibly play my father</p>
<p>so i no longer go to the movies</p>
<p>i don't see anymore movies at all</p>
   <p>///</p>
<p>so i walk down streets in spangles</p>
<p>as the old economy collapses</p>
<p>in the soggy sheets of The Atlantic</p>
<p>in the swamplike sheets of Manhattan</p>
<p>the critics are quiet</p>
   <p>///</p>
<p>to the last American to call out the names of every crumbling monument: did you ask for it?</p>
<p>///</p>
<p>the last time i went to the movies</p>
<p>i kept on shouting questions</p>
<p>to the characters in the movies</p>
<p>but these people had no answers</p>
<p>they had no answers at all</p>
   <p>///</p>
<p>when they told me to be quiet</p>
<p>enraged i said they had nothing</p>
<p>but the celluloid they depend on</p>
<p>they told me it's in digital</p>
<p>and that TV is better anyway</p>
