I knew in my younger days a bishop who wore open-toed sandals and a hibiscus patterned Hawaiian shirt—Father Bugleweed—compelling man, devoted to muscular Christianity, he’d found international fame as a young man in the forties giving speeches around the world on scripture and appropriate worship. I’d heard, for example, that while on a train tour of the Holy Land he spoke of the Book of Revelation—what he called ‘Coming Attractions’—and standing like a cowboy, with hands on both Old and New Testaments, he’d say in sonorous prayer: ‘Beware the allure of listless worship; use a planner!’ (The crowd, punctuating, ‘Hosanna in the Highest!’) And echoing Isaiah: ‘As the heavens are higher than the Earth, your ways are low as hell!’ (‘Hosanna in the Highest!’) And firing his rifle into the empty valley: ‘Here lies Christ the Redeemer! I’d rather be living in Philadelphia!’ (‘Hosanna. in. the. Highest!’) And having worked the crowd with his blustering sermons, he’d dance the two-step and play pass the hat, generally winning favor from all except the Arabs, who would pay him in sumac. 

<br /><br />Before my time, though. I knew him as a gadabout, and withering, a mainstay at the Episcopal church down the road from my house. His habit was to loiter near the entrance and insult Protestants. I’d been instructed to ignore him, and did so, reluctantly, until the day he threw at my head a statue of Lee Harvey Oswald nailed to the crucifix with the caption ‘Protestant Christ’. Needless to say, the image was compelling. Shortly thereafter he invited me to his bishopric, and I assented to meet with him on the condition that if he could give me five or ten good reasons to go Catholic, hell, I just might do it, but if he couldn’t, he had to give me his bishop hat. He said he didn’t want it, and gave it to me right there on the spot. 

<br /><br />Several days later I entered the diocese in V_____, and walked through the hanging door beads into his office. He’d been listening to Hildegard and throwing darts at a poster of Cyrus Roberts Vance, his feet on a stack of literally soiled Mennonite literature, and he turned to me and stuck his thumbs into my temples and started in with— ‘And so you agree that your head is full with animal concepts too limited to grasp the vast monadic logic of the Spirit?’—and there I was, barely had time to put down my Spiro Agnew lunchbox—‘and so you admit that your heresy is not the result of a failure of the Spirit but rather a crisis of the secular imaginary?’ Suddenly I felt a rush of spiritual energy kinda felt like an icepick headache—

<br /><br />‘And so you will banish the Spirit from your idiot head, and in its place fill it with thoughts of your failure, weakness, and impossible insignificance?’
 
<br /><br />‘I must do it!’ 

<br /><br />And by the next weekend we had both dressed up as Teddy Roosevelt circa Battle of San Juan Hill to take a one-way flight to Vatican City, where we were to distribute pamphlets arguing that John Paul II would be much better if he were Mussolini in pajamas; and so we drank orange soda at the Coliseum; and so we popped soccer balls outside the Stadio Olimpico; and so we handed schoolkids copies of the New Testament in which the center of the book had been cut out and replaced with a flask of liquid codeine; and so we threw coins into the Fontana di Trevi; and so Father Bugleweed proposed that I slip into the Apostolic Palace to inform the newly-minted pope that I was his long lost son from back when he was still cavorting with courtesans at U. Jagielloński, maybe then he could sneak into the Basilica for the papal inauguration, big speech on the balcony, a whole thing; and I’m thinking they probably sold out of tickets? 

<br /><br />Bugleweed placed his zucchetto upon my head with zeal, and we concocted a plan. Later that evening, I would tell the papal guards that I had a tummy ache, and that my parents were actually being baptized in the Pope’s bathtub, and so I had to bring them these Gingerbread scented Yankee Candles. The guards, turning out to be Y.C. aficionados themselves, said that the pope much preferred Cinnamon Stick, and noted that I could find a box or two in the appartamento pontificio, up two flights of stairs and through the third door on the left. No more than three minutes hence was I sitting on the new Pope’s lap, calling him poppa, and asking him to explain why he left me on the church steps in Kraków with all those nasty nuns. He, being a man of intelligence, quickly wrote me a check for twenty-five thousand dollars and told me to go nuts—but when he reached for a box labeled ‘flagellation components’, I determined it was best to knock him over the head with Bugleweed’s Oswald statue and steal his pallium—for both our sakes. The former I nailed to the wall with his rosary. The latter I schlepped back to Bugleweed before we split to the balcony for the main event. 

<br /><br />But first—

<br /><br />‘Get Roby the Snakeman,’ and like you I was thinking, ‘Who?’ And sure enough here arrived this seven-foot-tall Sicilian kid with like scale-tattoos all over his face. 

<br /><br />And so Bugleweed, looking like the Cowboy Pope of the World, strolled onto the balcony and started in on his sermon, first in a beguiling Latin that sounded like Portuguese, and then, repeating himself, in a brutally accented peasant Italian: 

<br /><br />‘God fearing wops:

<br /><br />Deny, protest, you’ll rot all the same. One can’t deny the rot that living imposes on us, on the race, what the hemisphere in full faith and credit has strived to deny for millennia, through kingship and law, alchemy and proto-science, pagan treatises on human nature, Hellenism, yada yada, practical philosophical education, monotheistic treatises on human nature, subjugation by race, aristocracy, cities, atheistic treatises on human nature, mechanical reproduction, cities,’ peppering his face with a sweat rag, ‘you know, cities? Those navels of violence, priesthoods, ghettos, Godheads, monogyny, polygyny, misogyny, misanthropy? The city. Axis mundi. Exploding outward,’ he drew a circle with his hand, ‘omphaloi, scientia potentia!’—glitter coming out of his sleeve, he’s a goddam wizard—‘scientism and commerce; one, the same. They are the beautiful weapons of psychoanalysts, economists, administrators, informers and informed. Of those who impede with abject scrupulosity, who atomize and gradate concern, stupidly adhering to God-given fallacies, Truman Doctrines, war games,’ bearing his palm, ‘the wondrous sensual nightmare of history in five acts: destroy, deny, defy, delouse, deify—and don’t think I excuse the Inquisition, nor apologize for it! I am not God, nor is it He, but rather We!’ 

<br /><br />At this point he retrieved a pear out of his poche, and bearing it— 

<br /><br />‘Imagine, this is your brain,’ 

<br /><br />Setting the fruit down—

<br /><br />‘This is history,’ 

<br /><br />Tying a rubber band around the base of it and reaching into his pocket— 

<br /><br />‘This is your brain on history,’ 

<br /><br />A beat, and then—whack!—he jammed the awl of a Swiss army knife into the pear, showers of juice dripped out onto the expectant crowd, by then rotund and huddled at the base of the Basilica, veritably dry-heaving, fighting with one another for scraps of fruit, screaming heresies in seventy-two different languages; and there was Roby the Snakeman, his body contorting at the moment of penetration, audibly moaning in the background: ‘His-s-s-tory!’ 

<br /><br />‘Stinks like a Callery tree in here,’ 

<br /><br />And Bugleweed’s reading out of his diary at this point— 

<br /><br />‘What do I know of Hollywood, aside from that I have not been there?’ and digressing, ‘A good martini has no olives, no lemon twist, no vermouth, just straight gin’; and it’s like fifteen minutes into it and he’s sweating through his everything; and some Vatican-types had already gotten hip to the fact that maybe this isn’t their new pope; and by God it was bacchanalia in papal square, and Bugleweed was in fact visibly aroused. Quickly, coppers arrived bearing clubs, along with a group of fascists outraged by any mention of Mussolini in the same breath as a Polack. 

<br /><br />Sensing danger, Bugleweed cut short his speech and hoisted me over his muscular shoulders, and then a fading view of Italian psychosexual street anarchy as I was carried dutifully to the airstrip to catch a chartered transatlantic flight flown by none other than Roby the Snakeman, who it turns out is not a Catholic but rather a pilot— 

<br /><br />Bugleweed was glowing, and far be it from me to judge him for it. To see him relive his glory days in the Holy See was a treat for me and my Spiro Agnew lunchbox. 

<br /><br />I turned to Bugleweed—

<br /><br />‘Father, that stuff you said,’ picking at my thumbs anxiously, ‘wasn’t necessarily doctrinaire, but maybe almost maybe atheistic, no offense.’ Bugleweed, unfazed, took off his hat and tousled his hair, and, after a few seconds delay— 

<br /><br />‘I’m not a Catholic, Clownboy.’ 

<br /><br />My name is Carl Clownboy, by the way, and I heard what you’re hearing, said ‘H-h-huh?’

<br /><br />‘I’m a Spinozist, and so’s Roby here.’ (Hissss from the front.) 

<br /><br />‘So… then… why are you in the Catholic church?’ I ask.

<br /><br />‘For the action,’ he said—and that was Father Bugleweed’s joke, one heroic lifetime in the making, and he never repeated it. He only said it once to me right there on the plane.
<br /><br />

Along the Mason-Dixon line, <br />
a lover’s quarrel ends<br />
so a vulgar sibling rivalry <br />
can finally take its place.   <br /><br />
And I—a non-sectarian— <br />
whose fun is to make amends—<br />
I’m lost, alone and lonely,<br />
and dreaming <br />
of your face.   <br /><br />
Up from land, up from dirty land.<br />
The land where all the love <br />
you’ve lost <br />
will soon be laid to rest.   <br /><br />
And there goes fine Paulinus,<br />
wandering empire’s finest.<br />
Bohos never change!<br />
But we know water creeps on<br />
Nola’s beaches <br />
past the lurid breakers,<br />
where the rapids meet the Gulf,<br />
where the Mississippi River splits <br />
and greens the Outer Shelf.<br /><br />
There’s a blond and preening <br />
Repo Man,<br />
all cool unchristian cant,<br />
on the last Southeastern island <br />
humming bebop to himself.<br /><br />
Up from land, up from dirty land.<br />
The land where all the love  <br />
you’ve lost <br />
will soon be laid to rest.<br /><br />
And those post hoc diviners <br />
talk of Lot’s but not Aquinas.<br />
Pray cum grain of salt<br />
and vibe like Philistines,<br />
so let’s not waste time <br />
whaling on the Ouachita <br />
and swearing at the bream.<br />
You’ll lie with something sinister <br />
or die in Club Passim.<br /><br />
Up from land, up from dirty land.<br />
The land where all the love  <br />
you’ve lost <br />
will soon be laid to rest.<br /><br /><br />
2 <br /><br />
My old man was a doctor,<br />
his allegiance to the blood.<br />
Sowed the nettle to his own tomb <br />
and his money made it like Mesud.<br /><br />
Westering, a kind of scoutlaw—<br />
middle west by middle road—<br />
held a Whole Earth in his right hand<br />
and there, to his left, a Barbary Coast.<br /><br />
Hear that sound? <br />
Drop City noise.<br />
All around, Drop City noise. <br />
Can’t you hear? <br />
Drop City noise.<br />
All around, called out at last.<br /><br />
Westward course of coronation,<br />
riding west of Capernaum,<br />
to Canaan or Colorado,<br />
reading Cybernetics like the <br />
psalms.<br /><br />
Fingers cursed to type in line<br />
from <br />
fingering the Rosary.<br />
In a church they coded Verbum,<br />
never leafing thru St. Augustine.<br /><br />
Hear that sound? <br />
Drop City noise.<br />
All around, Drop City noise.<br />
Can’t you hear? <br />
Drop City noise.<br />
All around, called out at last.<br /><br /> 
Bourgeois bladders <br />
can’t stand the ciders—<br />
pissing past the past. <br />
I was wary, you went across that <br />
line. <br />
No one is sacred.<br />
Six-Day scary, commentary<br />
burning like Sinai—oh!<br />
And Horus, playing us out.<br /><br />
Here the new-old cop Penutian,<br />
steal the sacred in Cheyenne,<br />
all for live-in mausoleums <br />
for the saintly Stanford man. <br /><br />
Hear that sound? <br />
Drop City noise.<br />
All around, Drop City noise <br />
Can’t you hear? <br />
Drop City noise <br />
Hear that sound called out at 
last.<br /><br /><br />
3 <br /><br />
Cruel world,<br />
breakfast by the Old Stone House,<br />
family affair,<br />
the refrigerator’s hundred gauss.<br /><br />
In Volta Bureau,<br />
eyes to phone, Graphophonic cue 
to decode.<br />
On Volta Park land,<br />
there headstones paved <br />
a passage in place of the road.<br /><br />
And a map hangs crooked in the corner near the bar <br />
and a man stands staring at the Costanoan land <br />
where the great-grandchildren of bootleggers <br />
position pegs of donut shops by hand.<br /><br />
Along the Beltway <br />
monuments indicate a memory <br />
traced.<br /><br />
Like this Vinland map, say:<br />
15th cent. but it’s covered in fresh <br />
anatase.<br /><br />
Like Çatalhöyük <br />
mocked the spots of the leopard décor.<br />
Like Waldseemüller <br />
named a square by the 95-<br />
corridor.<br /><br />
And a map hangs crooked in the corner near the bar<br />
and a man stands staring at the Costanoan land<br />
where the great grandchildren of bootleggers <br />
position pegs of donut shops by hand.<br /><br />
There a man falls thumbing at the coronated cabs <br />
while a teenager’s sitting dour at the stand.<br />
All the while he’s thumbing at a screen, <br />
calls a six door uninsured <br />
wheezing Kombi van <br />
with a map framed crooked in his flushed and hardened hands—<br />
his weird Old Dominion over East Algonquian land,<br />
where the great-grandchildren of bootleggers <br />
position pegs in yule <br />
Afghanistan.<br /><br />
A palimpsest:<br />
In the grid <br />
you discover yourself,<br />
like a stencil,<br />
retracing the work of<br /> 
someone else.<br /><br /><br />
4<br /><br />
Rhoticity sounds <br />
so much sweeter in the South;<br />
but Rhodes will confound <br />
and you grow grim about the mouth.<br /><br />
The time is never right,<br />
and a broken watch just twice,<br />
but Oxford’s working for a Third Boer War, <br />
so fight back, baby, or you’ll halve <br />
that old Dutch door.<br /><br />
Rhodesia dined <br />
on rhodium to anglicize <br />
loanwords to modify <br />
Jodhpur boots to colonize <br />
in Mashonaland and try <br />
where the Falklands met Brunei—<br />
where the textbooks sounded as <br />
one wretched word,<br />
and the Beit Trust covered every case on <br />
loss incurred.<br /><br />
You wait for me, I’ll show the way out.<br />
Wait for me, I’ll know the way out.<br />
Wait for me to let your hungry heart <br />
combine with mine.<br /><br />
Interred, as sure forgot—<br />
old ideas cannot rot. <br />
Their covenant’s cleared,<br />
so grab the pisco, <br />
fuck De Beers. <br /><br />
The city is too dear.<br />
Let go your good Bronx cheer.<br />
When the West Coast’s rotted like a <br />
junkyard car<br />
and the East Coast’s flooded, baby,<br /> 
can’t go too far.<br /><br />
Wait for me to loan the day out.<br />
Wait for me to blow my brains out.<br />
Wait for me to let your hungry heart <br />
combine with mine.<br /><br /><br />
5<br /><br />
There’s no one in Hollywood <br />
who could possibly play my father<br />
so I no longer go to the movies.<br />
I don’t see anymore movies at all.<br /><br />
Now I walk down streets of amber <br />
as the old economy collapses.<br />
In the swamp-like streets of Manhattan,<br />
in the soggy sheets of the Atlantic<br />
the critics are quiet.<br /><br />
To the last American <br />
to call out the names <br />
of every crumbling monument: <br />
did you ask for it? <br /><br />
The last time I went to the movies <br />
I kept on shouting questions <br />
to the characters in the movie <br />
but these people had no answers at all.<br /><br />
When they told me to be quiet<br />
enraged I said they had nothing <br />
but the celluloid they depend on.<br />
They told me it’s in digital <br />
and that TV is better anyway.<br /><br />
To the last American <br />
to call out the names <br />
of every crumbling monument: <br />
did you ask for it? <br /><br /><br />
6<br /><br />
I walked the Coulee Dam.<br />
Now I, followed by a Ford on 55, <br />
will ride that Chrome back home— <br />
some ride.<br /><br />

High art from Pliocene.<br />
A dam followed the flood <br />
and then the workers’ blood to dam— <br />
don’t lie, whose land? <br />
King Columbia? <br />
Damn creditors.<br />
Scum, predators.<br />
Some coffers they’re constructing on the Rhône.<br />
No hope.<br /><br />

Around the fishing ground <br />
a quiet settled death <br />
spawned trouble for the West Indian— <br />
and Guthrie said this thing was grand? <br />
Graves watery,<br />
in cautery,<br />
they relocated certain burial grounds.<br />
Some drowned.<br /><br />

Belgium wastes.<br />
Belgium steals and takes.<br />
Belgium hates.<br />
No doubt in my heart: <br />
We, too.<br /><br />

A Congo riverboat <br />
surveys fifty meters up the northward face of Inga, <br />
caps a grayscale: <br />
“MK”.<br /><br />

Cut to le Roi-des-Belges:<br />
“J’y suivais un serpent qui venait de me mordre.”<br />
“Demi mort? <br />
Your accent’s poor, speak up, say more.<br />
Quel endroit?”<br />
“Atlantropa—<br />
Ein Damm über den Straße von Gibraltar.” <br /><br />

Belgium wastes.<br />
Belgium steals and takes.<br />
Belgium hates.<br />
No doubt in my heart: <br />
We, too.<br /><br /><br />
   

<img src="NNW13.jpg">
      
7<br /><br />
I slammed the door in your eyes.<br />
How nice.<br />
Dido, your friend,<br />
had just died from a joke I read.<br />
You all knew I was on strike from the word,<br />
and luring me out with a light<br />
like a moth I stirred.<br /><br />
In Carthage harbor,<br />
crown clerks, courtiers<br />
talk like marchers <br />
and drop like martyrs.<br />
Well I’m their author, <br />
their colporteur, yeah,<br />
but I’m not their guy—<br />
Oh! <br /><br />
No sentiment for a month, just Donne.<br />
Lying at length in a bath <br />
with the clergyman.<br /><br />
Ressentiment for a world without <br />
your testament.<br />
What a joke.<br />
What a cruel cry-out.<br /><br />
Our love had value—<br />
still, St. Matthew walks the earth <br />
but I’m without you.<br />
I’m aphonic, anhedonic now <br />
that I’m not your guy—<br />
Oh!<br /><br />
I came home that night,<br />
stormed back inside,<br />
and fell inept apart.<br />
Even failed that. <br />
No luck,<br />
no time,<br />
no suffering signs—<br />
I’ll just attempt to be <br />
someone who can’t die.<br /><br /><br />
8<br /><br />
One night while cursing Japheth,<br />
I noticed that I loved <br />
my lover more than she did me,<br />
then I fell out of bed.<br /><br />
We slept on Egyptian sheets <br />
that burned and chafed the skin.<br />
I couldn’t wrench them from our bed <br />
’til we were sleeping again.<br /><br />
And when I knew that she would bail <br />
I sang along with the nightingale.<br /><br />
I woke instead with a book<br />
containing every word <br />
excluded from the dictionary.<br />
Hilarity ensued.<br /><br />
It read in six languages <br />
and quoted me at length—<br />
it talked in polysemous bleats, <br />
e.g. angst was a shriek.<br /><br />
And when I wrote bad to its author <br />
he mailed me a buck with a note that read: <br /><br />
“Well, Cyndi Lauper was wrong—<br />
or at least misguided.<br />
You’d rather writhe in my arms for the night.”<br /> <br />
And today I ask as any other: <br />
Who do you dignify? <br /><br />
No more then I said yesterday.<br /><br /><br />
9<br /><br />
During catechesis we’d seen the church <br />
St. Philip Neri had preferred.<br />
In labyrinths of sepulture and myrrh<br />
we lay where San Sebastian was interred.<br /><br />
And dozing off I dreamt of you and I entwined,<br />
and we were buried in the yard.<br />
In cold uncaring dirt soothed by neither stars <br />
nor aperture nor God.<br /><br />
Then he said don’t be salacious in deed.<br />
(The Levantine contorts himself to be believed.)<br /><br />
In Jericho, he knows, <br />
they’d bury three or more <br />
beneath their beds in such a rite.<br /><br />
The Baader-Meinhof Gang were buried stacked in threes,<br />
a triple grave commemorates the night they died, <br />
and every offering is tripartite.<br /><br />
In Dolní Věstonice they say <br />
the Trinity is still the rule.<br /><br /> 
The Levantine, he just spat out his gum <br />
when told I’d been studied this in school.<br /><br />
Well supposing it’s true,<br />
that the right love is three not two—<br />
But I love you.<br />
And I’m supposed to lay some person who—?<br />
Oh! <br /><br />
It buried me alive when you said you don’t love— <br />
It buried me alive when you said you don’t Love Me Do.<br />
I’m crying.<br /><br />
Morbidly, I know the dead don’t grieve.<br />
Eternity is bunk,<br />
but for only the lonely.<br />
Oh! <br /><br />
They buried <br />
one alive, faced down and arm in arm with <br />
two faced up, the hand of <br />
three across their crotch— <br />
if only the Levantine had seen.<br />
I’m dying.<br /><br /><br />
10<br /><br />
Foregone, like a border drawn,<br />
his map not to amend.<br /><br />

Anon, soon the seventh horn,<br />
full throats do portend <br />
the end.<br /><br />

O, maritime vile.<br /><br />

At nine, toss the sounding line,<br />
bear the beak-head down.<br /><br />

Beware the sailor’s morning prayer<br />
from only water drunk.<br /><br />

In there, the Master-at-Arms lair,<br />
read the Rights-of-Man.<br />
O, maritime vile.<br /><br />

Look there: the colonizer stares<br />
at broke barometer, sighs.<br /><br />

And fair, the ground does plunder where<br />
dreadful riches were once.<br /><br />

Pull rank, the foreman’s chart is blank.<br />
Its measure used to be read <br />
in maritime miles.<br /><br /><br />

11<br /><br />
Uni Popular—<br />
Can I be popular?<br />
What does it really mean to be popular?<br />
What if I told you I don’t wanna be popular?<br /><br />
I met this same person twice before.<br />
They told of art school prophets far too cool to just ignore.<br />
Where the old lines fall flat, you see,<br />
their suburban parables were too arcane for a friend like me.<br /><br />
And now I see their double stumble in the streets by day.<br />
And when I’m out on Brook I have to break it for the alley way.<br />
Let be be final— <br />
I know it’s best this way.<br />
But every time I bring you up it’s all in metaphor and sobriquet. <br />
Tell the truth.<br /><br />
And but we never even had the time to feign.<br />
Too busy cussing Kissingers and thumbing Charlemagnes.<br />
And when I came to find my love for one plussed two<br />
affaire de coure just seemed to me like such a bogus move.<br /><br />
Tell the truth.<br />
I know you.<br />
What’s your problem? <br />
Just tell the truth.<br /><br /><br />
12<br /><br />
I want to trust <br />
that you and I are good as us.<br />
Of everyone<br />
it’s got to be that I could not be billions.<br /><br />
But from your heart I cannot claim to will a part <br />
from it free port<br />
and neither you nor I will chart nor guide consort.<br /><br />
To see to that we’re right, <br />
while the kids keep running aground, <br />
take what they like.<br /><br />
Amongst the skids,<br />
below the draft is where I live.<br />
From stern to dip<br />
I bream with fire, graft, and forceful fingertip.<br /><br />
See, you and I, we’re right—<br />
a problem in all the same ways <br />
but we know that’s trite.<br /><br />
This is your paradise. <br />
Lost in the paradise. <br /><br />
