1   <br /><br />

Along the Mason-Dixon line, <br />
a lover’s quarrel ends<br />
so a vulgar sibling rivalry <br />
can finally take its place.   <br /><br />
And I—a non-sectarian— <br />
whose fun is to make amends—<br />
I’m lost, alone and lonely,<br />
and dreaming <br />
of your face.   <br /><br />
Up from land, up from dirty land.<br />
The land where all the love <br />
you’ve lost <br />
will soon be laid to rest.   <br /><br />
And there goes fine Paulinus,<br />
wandering empire’s finest.<br />
Bohos never change!<br />
But we know water creeps on<br />
Nola’s beaches <br />
past the lurid breakers,<br />
where the rapids meet the Gulf,<br />
where the Mississippi River splits <br />
and greens the Outer Shelf.<br /><br />
There’s a blond and preening <br />
Repo Man,<br />
all cool unchristian cant,<br />
on the last Southeastern island <br />
humming bebop to himself.<br /><br />
Up from land, up from dirty land.<br />
The land where all the love  <br />
you’ve lost <br />
will soon be laid to rest.<br /><br />
And those post hoc diviners <br />
talk of Lot’s but not Aquinas.<br />
Pray cum grain of salt<br />
and vibe like Philistines,<br />
so let’s not waste time <br />
whaling on the Ouachita <br />
and swearing at the bream.<br />
You’ll lie with something sinister <br />
or die in Club Passim.<br /><br />
Up from land, up from dirty land.<br />
The land where all the love  <br />
you’ve lost <br />
will soon be laid to rest.<br /><br /><br />
2 <br /><br />
My old man was a doctor,<br />
his allegiance to the blood.<br />
Sowed the nettle to his own tomb <br />
and his money made it like Mesud.<br /><br />
Westering, a kind of scoutlaw—<br />
middle west by middle road—<br />
held a Whole Earth in his right hand<br />
and there, to his left, a Barbary Coast.<br /><br />
Hear that sound? <br />
Drop City noise.<br />
All around, Drop City noise. <br />
Can’t you hear? <br />
Drop City noise.<br />
All around, called out at last.<br /><br />
Westward course of coronation,<br />
riding west of Capernaum,<br />
to Canaan or Colorado,<br />
reading Cybernetics like the <br />
psalms.<br /><br />
Fingers cursed to type in line<br />
from <br />
fingering the Rosary.<br />
In a church they coded Verbum,<br />
never leafing thru St. Augustine.<br /><br />
Hear that sound? <br />
Drop City noise.<br />
All around, Drop City noise.<br />
Can’t you hear? <br />
Drop City noise.<br />
All around, called out at last.<br /><br /> 
Bourgeois bladders <br />
can’t stand the ciders—<br />
pissing past the past. <br />
I was wary, you went across that <br />
line. <br />
No one is sacred.<br />
Six-Day scary, commentary<br />
burning like Sinai—oh!<br />
And Horus, playing us out.<br /><br />
Here the new-old cop Penutian,<br />
steal the sacred in Cheyenne,<br />
all for live-in mausoleums <br />
for the saintly Stanford man. <br /><br />
Hear that sound? <br />
Drop City noise.<br />
All around, Drop City noise <br />
Can’t you hear? <br />
Drop City noise <br />
Hear that sound called out at 
last.<br /><br /><br />
3 <br /><br />
Cruel world,<br />
breakfast by the Old Stone House,<br />
family affair,<br />
the refrigerator’s hundred gauss.<br /><br />
In Volta Bureau,<br />
eyes to phone, Graphophonic cue 
to decode.<br />
On Volta Park land,<br />
there headstones paved <br />
a passage in place of the road.<br /><br />
And a map hangs crooked in the corner near the bar <br />
and a man stands staring at the Costanoan land <br />
where the great-grandchildren of bootleggers <br />
position pegs of donut shops by hand.<br /><br />
Along the Beltway <br />
monuments indicate a memory <br />
traced.<br /><br />
Like this Vinland map, say:<br />
15th cent. but it’s covered in fresh <br />
anatase.<br /><br />
Like Çatalhöyük <br />
mocked the spots of the leopard décor.<br />
Like Waldseemüller <br />
named a square by the 95-<br />
corridor.<br /><br />
And a map hangs crooked in the corner near the bar<br />
and a man stands staring at the Costanoan land<br />
where the great grandchildren of bootleggers <br />
position pegs of donut shops by hand.<br /><br />
There a man falls thumbing at the coronated cabs <br />
while a teenager’s sitting dour at the stand.<br />
All the while he’s thumbing at a screen, <br />
calls a six door uninsured <br />
wheezing Kombi van <br />
with a map framed crooked in his flushed and hardened hands—<br />
his weird Old Dominion over East Algonquian land,<br />
where the great-grandchildren of bootleggers <br />
position pegs in yule <br />
Afghanistan.<br /><br />
A palimpsest:<br />
In the grid <br />
you discover yourself,<br />
like a stencil,<br />
retracing the work of<br /> 
someone else.<br /><br /><br />
4<br /><br />
Rhoticity sounds <br />
so much sweeter in the South;<br />
but Rhodes will confound <br />
and you grow grim about the mouth.<br /><br />
The time is never right,<br />
and a broken watch just twice,<br />
but Oxford’s working for a Third Boer War, <br />
so fight back, baby, or you’ll halve <br />
that old Dutch door.<br /><br />
Rhodesia dined <br />
on rhodium to anglicize <br />
loanwords to modify <br />
Jodhpur boots to colonize <br />
in Mashonaland and try <br />
where the Falklands met Brunei—<br />
where the textbooks sounded as <br />
one wretched word,<br />
and the Beit Trust covered every case on <br />
loss incurred.<br /><br />
You wait for me, I’ll show the way out.<br />
Wait for me, I’ll know the way out.<br />
Wait for me to let your hungry heart <br />
combine with mine.<br /><br />
Interred, as sure forgot—<br />
old ideas cannot rot. <br />
Their covenant’s cleared,<br />
so grab the pisco, <br />
fuck De Beers. <br /><br />
The city is too dear.<br />
Let go your good Bronx cheer.<br />
When the West Coast’s rotted like a <br />
junkyard car<br />
and the East Coast’s flooded, baby,<br /> 
can’t go too far.<br /><br />
Wait for me to loan the day out.<br />
Wait for me to blow my brains out.<br />
Wait for me to let your hungry heart <br />
combine with mine.<br /><br /><br />
5<br /><br />
There’s no one in Hollywood <br />
who could possibly play my father<br />
so I no longer go to the movies.<br />
I don’t see anymore movies at all.<br /><br />
Now I walk down streets of amber <br />
as the old economy collapses.<br />
In the swamp-like streets of Manhattan,<br />
in the soggy sheets of the Atlantic<br />
the critics are quiet.<br /><br />
To the last American <br />
to call out the names <br />
of every crumbling monument: <br />
did you ask for it? <br /><br />
The last time I went to the movies <br />
I kept on shouting questions <br />
to the characters in the movie <br />
but these people had no answers at all.<br /><br />
When they told me to be quiet<br />
enraged I said they had nothing <br />
but the celluloid they depend on.<br />
They told me it’s in digital <br />
and that TV is better anyway.<br /><br />
To the last American <br />
to call out the names <br />
of every crumbling monument: <br />
did you ask for it? <br /><br /><br />
6<br /><br />
I walked the Coulee Dam.<br />
Now I, followed by a Ford on 55, <br />
will ride that Chrome back home— <br />
some ride.<br /><br />

High art from Pliocene.<br />
A dam followed the flood <br />
and then the workers’ blood to dam— <br />
don’t lie, whose land? <br />
King Columbia? <br />
Damn creditors.<br />
Scum, predators.<br />
Some coffers they’re constructing on the Rhône.<br />
No hope.<br /><br />

Around the fishing ground <br />
a quiet settled death <br />
spawned trouble for the West Indian— <br />
and Guthrie said this thing was grand? <br />
Graves watery,<br />
in cautery,<br />
they relocated certain burial grounds.<br />
Some drowned.<br /><br />

Belgium wastes.<br />
Belgium steals and takes.<br />
Belgium hates.<br />
No doubt in my heart: <br />
We, too.<br /><br />

A Congo riverboat <br />
surveys fifty meters up the northward face of Inga, <br />
caps a grayscale: <br />
“MK”.<br /><br />

Cut to le Roi-des-Belges:<br />
“J’y suivais un serpent qui venait de me mordre.”<br />
“Demi mort? <br />
Your accent’s poor, speak up, say more.<br />
Quel endroit?”<br />
“Atlantropa—<br />
Ein Damm über den Straße von Gibraltar.” <br /><br />

Belgium wastes.<br />
Belgium steals and takes.<br />
Belgium hates.<br />
No doubt in my heart: <br />
We, too.<br /><br /><br />
7<br /><br />
I slammed the door in your eyes.<br />
How nice.<br />
Dido, your friend,<br />
had just died from a joke I read.<br />
You all knew I was on strike from the word,<br />
and luring me out with a light<br />
like a moth I stirred.<br /><br />
In Carthage harbor,<br />
crown clerks, courtiers<br />
talk like marchers <br />
and drop like martyrs.<br />
Well I’m their author, <br />
their colporteur, yeah,<br />
but I’m not their guy—<br />
Oh! <br /><br />
No sentiment for a month, just Donne.<br />
Lying at length in a bath <br />
with the clergyman.<br /><br />
Ressentiment for a world without <br />
your testament.<br />
What a joke.<br />
What a cruel cry-out.<br /><br />
Our love had value—<br />
still, St. Matthew walks the earth <br />
but I’m without you.<br />
I’m aphonic, anhedonic now <br />
that I’m not your guy—<br />
Oh!<br /><br />
I came home that night,<br />
stormed back inside,<br />
and fell inept apart.<br />
Even failed that. <br />
No luck,<br />
no time,<br />
no suffering signs—<br />
I’ll just attempt to be <br />
someone who can’t die.<br /><br /><br />
8<br /><br />
One night while cursing Japheth,<br />
I noticed that I loved <br />
my lover more than she did me,<br />
then I fell out of bed.<br /><br />
We slept on Egyptian sheets <br />
that burned and chafed the skin.<br />
I couldn’t wrench them from our bed <br />
’til we were sleeping again.<br /><br />
And when I knew that she would bail <br />
I sang along with the nightingale.<br /><br />
I woke instead with a book<br />
containing every word <br />
excluded from the dictionary.<br />
Hilarity ensued.<br /><br />
It read in six languages <br />
and quoted me at length—<br />
it talked in polysemous bleats, <br />
e.g. angst was a shriek.<br /><br />
And when I wrote bad to its author <br />
he mailed me a buck with a note that read: <br /><br />
“Well, Cyndi Lauper was wrong—<br />
or at least misguided.<br />
You’d rather writhe in my arms for the night.”<br /> <br />
And today I ask as any other: <br />
Who do you dignify? <br /><br />
No more then I said yesterday.<br /><br /><br />
9<br /><br />
During catechesis we’d seen the church <br />
St. Philip Neri had preferred.<br />
In labyrinths of sepulture and myrrh<br />
we lay where San Sebastian was interred.<br /><br />
And dozing off I dreamt of you and I entwined,<br />
and we were buried in the yard.<br />
In cold uncaring dirt soothed by neither stars <br />
nor aperture nor God.<br /><br />
Then he said don’t be salacious in deed.<br />
(The Levantine contorts himself to be believed.)<br /><br />
In Jericho, he knows, <br />
they’d bury three or more <br />
beneath their beds in such a rite.<br /><br />
The Baader-Meinhof Gang were buried stacked in threes,<br />
a triple grave commemorates the night they died, <br />
and every offering is tripartite.<br /><br />
In Dolní Věstonice they say <br />
the Trinity is still the rule.<br /><br /> 
The Levantine, he just spat out his gum <br />
when told I’d been studied this in school.<br /><br />
Well supposing it’s true,<br />
that the right love is three not two—<br />
But I love you.<br />
And I’m supposed to lay some person who—?<br />
Oh! <br /><br />
It buried me alive when you said you don’t love— <br />
It buried me alive when you said you don’t Love Me Do.<br />
I’m crying.<br /><br />
Morbidly, I know the dead don’t grieve.<br />
Eternity is bunk,<br />
but for only the lonely.<br />
Oh! <br /><br />
They buried <br />
one alive, faced down and arm in arm with <br />
two faced up, the hand of <br />
three across their crotch— <br />
if only the Levantine had seen.<br />
I’m dying.<br /><br /><br />
10<br /><br />
Foregone, like a border drawn,<br />
his map not to amend.<br /><br />

Anon, soon the seventh horn,<br />
full throats do portend <br />
the end.<br /><br />

O, maritime vile.<br /><br />

At nine, toss the sounding line,<br />
bear the beak-head down.<br /><br />

Beware the sailor’s morning prayer<br />
from only water drunk.<br /><br />

In there, the Master-at-Arms lair,<br />
read the Rights-of-Man.<br />
O, maritime vile.<br /><br />

Look there: the colonizer stares<br />
at broke barometer, sighs.<br /><br />

And fair, the ground does plunder where<br />
dreadful riches were once.<br /><br />

Pull rank, the foreman’s chart is blank.<br />
Its measure used to be read <br />
in maritime miles.<br /><br /><br />

11<br /><br />
Uni Popular—<br />
Can I be popular?<br />
What does it really mean to be popular?<br />
What if I told you I don’t wanna be popular?<br /><br />
I met this same person twice before.<br />
They told of art school prophets far too cool to just ignore.<br />
Where the old lines fall flat, you see,<br />
their suburban parables were too arcane for a friend like me.<br /><br />
And now I see their double stumble in the streets by day.<br />
And when I’m out on Brook I have to break it for the alley way.<br />
Let be be final— <br />
I know it’s best this way.<br />
But every time I bring you up it’s all in metaphor and sobriquet. <br />
Tell the truth.<br /><br />
And but we never even had the time to feign.<br />
Too busy cussing Kissingers and thumbing Charlemagnes.<br />
And when I came to find my love for one plussed two<br />
affaire de coure just seemed to me like such a bogus move.<br /><br />
Tell the truth.<br />
I know you.<br />
What’s your problem? <br />
Just tell the truth.<br /><br /><br />
12<br /><br />
I want to trust <br />
that you and I are good as us.<br />
Of everyone<br />
it’s got to be that I could not be billions.<br /><br />
But from your heart I cannot claim to will a part <br />
from it free port<br />
and neither you nor I will chart nor guide consort.<br /><br />
To see to that we’re right, <br />
while the kids keep running aground, <br />
take what they like.<br /><br />
Amongst the skids,<br />
below the draft is where I live.<br />
From stern to dip<br />
I bream with fire, graft, and forceful fingertip.<br /><br />
See, you and I, we’re right—<br />
a problem in all the same ways <br />
but we know that’s trite.<br /><br />
This is your paradise. <br />
Lost in the paradise. <br /><br />
