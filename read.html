Along the Mason-Dixon line, <br />
a lover’s quarrel ends<br />
so a vulgar sibling rivalry <br />
can finally take its place.   <br /><br />
And I—a non-sectarian— <br />
whose fun is to make amends—<br />
I’m lost, alone and lonely,<br />
and dreaming <br />
of your face.   <br /><br />
Up from land, up from dirty land.<br />
The land where all the love <br />
you’ve lost <br />
will soon be laid to rest.   <br /><br />
And there goes fine Paulinus,<br />
wandering empire’s finest.<br />
Bohos never change!<br />
But we know water creeps on<br />
Nola’s beaches <br />
past the lurid breakers,<br />
where the rapids meet the Gulf,<br />
where the Mississippi River splits <br />
and greens the Outer Shelf.<br /><br />
There’s a blond and preening <br />
Repo Man,<br />
all cool unchristian cant,<br />
on the last Southeastern island <br />
humming bebop to himself.<br /><br />
Up from land, up from dirty land.<br />
The land where all the love  <br />
you’ve lost <br />
will soon be laid to rest.<br /><br />
And those post hoc diviners <br />
talk of Lot’s but not Aquinas.<br />
Pray cum grain of salt<br />
and vibe like Philistines,<br />
so let’s not waste time <br />
whaling on the Ouachita <br />
and swearing at the bream.<br />
You’ll lie with something sinister <br />
or die in Club Passim.<br /><br />
Up from land, up from dirty land.<br />
The land where all the love  <br />
you’ve lost <br />
will soon be laid to rest.<br /><br />

My old man was a doctor,
his allegiance to the blood.
Sowed the nettle to his own tomb 
and his money made it like Mesud.
Westering, a kind of scoutlaw—
middle west by middle road—
held a Whole Earth in his right hand
and there, to his left, a Barbary Coast.
Hear that sound? 
Drop City noise.
All around, Drop City noise. 
Can’t you hear? 
Drop City noise.
All around, called out at last.
Westward course of coronation,
riding west of Capernaum,
to Canaan or Colorado,
reading Cybernetics like the 
psalms.
Fingers cursed to type in line
from 
fingering the Rosary.
In a church they coded Verbum,
never leafing thru St. Augustine.
Hear that sound? 
Drop City noise.
All around, Drop City noise.
Can’t you hear? 
Drop City noise.
All around, called out at last. 
Bourgeois bladders 
can’t stand the ciders—
pissing past the past. 
I was wary, you went across that 
line. 
No one is sacred.
Six-Day scary, commentary
burning like Sinai—oh!
And Horus, playing us out.
Here the new-old cop Penutian,
steal the sacred in Cheyenne,
all for live-in mausoleums 
for the saintly Stanford man. 
Hear that sound? 
Drop City noise.
All around, Drop City noise 
Can’t you hear? 
Drop City noise 
Hear that sound called out at 
last.

Cruel world,
breakfast by the Old Stone House,
family affair,
the refrigerator’s hundred gauss.
In Volta Bureau,
eyes to phone, Graphophonic cue 
to decode.
On Volta Park land,
there headstones paved 
a passage in place of the road.
And a map hangs crooked in the corner near the bar 
and a man stands staring at the Costanoan land 
where the great-grandchildren of bootleggers 
position pegs of donut shops by hand.
Along the Beltway 
monuments indicate a memory 
traced.
Like this Vinland map, say:
15th cent. but it’s covered in fresh 
anatase.
Like Çatalhöyük 
mocked the spots of the leopard décor.
Like Waldseemüller 
named a square by the 95-
corridor.
And a map hangs crooked in the corner near the bar
and a man stands staring at the Costanoan land
where the great grandchildren of bootleggers 
position pegs of donut shops by hand.
There a man falls thumbing at the coronated cabs 
while a teenager’s sitting dour at the stand.
All the while he’s thumbing at a screen, 
calls a six door uninsured 
wheezing Kombi van 
with a map framed crooked in his flushed and hardened hands—
his weird Old Dominion over East Algonquian land,
where the great-grandchildren of bootleggers 
position pegs in yule 
Afghanistan.
A palimpsest:
In the grid 
you discover yourself,
like a stencil,
retracing the work of 
someone else.

Rhoticity sounds 
so much sweeter in the South;
but Rhodes will confound 
and you grow grim about the mouth.
The time is never right,
and a broken watch just twice,
but Oxford’s working for a Third Boer War, 
so fight back, baby, or you’ll halve 
that old Dutch door.
Rhodesia dined 
on rhodium to anglicize 
loanwords to modify 
Jodhpur boots to colonize 
in Mashonaland and try 
where the Falklands met Brunei—
where the textbooks sounded as 
one wretched word,
and the Beit Trust covered every case on 
loss incurred.
You wait for me, I’ll show the way out.
Wait for me, I’ll know the way out.
Wait for me to let your hungry heart 
combine with mine.
Interred, as sure forgot—
old ideas cannot rot. 
Their covenant’s cleared,
so grab the pisco, 
fuck De Beers. 
The city is too dear.
Let go your good Bronx cheer.
When the West Coast’s rotted like a 
junkyard car
and the East Coast’s flooded, baby, 
can’t go too far.
Wait for me to loan the day out.
Wait for me to blow my brains out.
Wait for me to let your hungry heart 
combine with mine.

There’s no one in Hollywood 
who could possibly play my father
so I no longer go to the movies.
I don’t see anymore movies at all.
Now I walk down streets of amber 
as the old economy collapses.
In the swamp-like streets of Manhattan,
in the soggy sheets of the Atlantic
the critics are quiet.
To the last American 
to call out the names 
of every crumbling monument: 
did you ask for it? 
The last time I went to the movies 
I kept on shouting questions 
to the characters in the movie 
but these people had no answers at all.
When they told me to be quiet
enraged I said they had nothing 
but the celluloid they depend on.
They told me it’s in digital 
and that TV is better anyway.
To the last American 
to call out the names 
of every crumbling monument: 
did you ask for it?

I walked the Coulee Dam.
Now I, followed by a Ford on 55, 
will ride that Chrome back home— 
some ride.

High art from Pliocene.
A dam followed the flood 
and then the workers’ blood to dam— 
don’t lie, whose land? 
King Columbia? 
Damn creditors.
Scum, predators.
Some coffers they’re constructing on the Rhône.
No hope.

Around the fishing ground 
a quiet settled death 
spawned trouble for the West Indian— 
and Guthrie said this thing was grand? 
Graves watery,
in cautery,
they relocated certain burial grounds.
Some drowned.

Belgium wastes.
Belgium steals and takes.
Belgium hates.
No doubt in my heart: 
We, too.

A Congo riverboat 
surveys fifty meters up the northward face of Inga, 
caps a grayscale: 
“MK”.

Cut to le Roi-des-Belges:
“J’y suivais un serpent qui venait de me mordre.”
“Demi mort? 
Your accent’s poor, speak up, say more.
Quel endroit?”
“Atlantropa—
Ein Damm über den Straße von Gibraltar.” 

Belgium wastes.
Belgium steals and takes.
Belgium hates.
No doubt in my heart: 
We, too.

I slammed the door in your eyes.
How nice.
Dido, your friend,
had just died from a joke I read.
You all knew I was on strike from the word,
and luring me out with a light
like a moth I stirred.
In Carthage harbor,
crown clerks, courtiers
talk like marchers 
and drop like martyrs.
Well I’m their author, 
their colporteur, yeah,
but I’m not their guy—
Oh! 
No sentiment for a month, just Donne.
Lying at length in a bath 
with the clergyman.
Ressentiment for a world without 
your testament.
What a joke.
What a cruel cry-out.
Our love had value—
still, St. Matthew walks the earth 
but I’m without you.
I’m aphonic, anhedonic now 
that I’m not your guy—
Oh!
I came home that night,
stormed back inside,
and fell inept apart.
Even failed that. 
No luck,
no time,
no suffering signs—
I’ll just attempt to be 
someone who can’t die.

One night while cursing Japheth,
I noticed that I loved 
my lover more than she did me,
then I fell out of bed.
We slept on Egyptian sheets 
that burned and chafed the skin.
I couldn’t wrench them from our bed 
’til we were sleeping again.
And when I knew that she would bail 
I sang along with the nightingale.
I woke instead with a book
containing every word 
excluded from the dictionary.
Hilarity ensued.
It read in six languages 
and quoted me at length—
it talked in polysemous bleats, 
e.g. angst was a shriek.
And when I wrote bad to its author 
he mailed me a buck with a note that read: 
“Well, Cyndi Lauper was wrong—
or at least misguided.
You’d rather writhe in my arms for the night.” 
And today I ask as any other: 
Who do you dignify? 
No more then I said yesterday.

During catechesis we’d seen the church 
St. Philip Neri had preferred.
In labyrinths of sepulture and myrrh
we lay where San Sebastian was interred.
And dozing off I dreamt of you and I entwined,
and we were buried in the yard.
In cold uncaring dirt soothed by neither stars 
nor aperture nor God.
Then he said don’t be salacious in deed.
(The Levantine contorts himself to be believed.)
In Jericho, he knows, 
they’d bury three or more 
beneath their beds in such a rite.
The Baader-Meinhof Gang were buried stacked in threes,
a triple grave commemorates the night they died, 
and every offering is tripartite.
In Dolní Věstonice they say 
the Trinity is still the rule. 
The Levantine, he just spat out his gum 
when told I’d been studied this in school.
Well supposing it’s true,
that the right love is three not two—
But I love you.
And I’m supposed to lay some person who—?
Oh! 
It buried me alive when you said you don’t love— 
It buried me alive when you said you don’t Love Me Do.
I’m crying.
Morbidly, I know the dead don’t grieve.
Eternity is bunk,
but for only the lonely.
Oh! 
They buried 
one alive, faced down and arm in arm with 
two faced up, the hand of 
three across their crotch— 
if only the Levantine had seen.
I’m dying.
10
Foregone, like a border drawn,
his map not to amend.

Anon, soon the seventh horn,
full throats do portend 
the end.

O, maritime vile.

At nine, toss the sounding line,
bear the beak-head down.

Beware the sailor’s morning prayer
from only water drunk.

In there, the Master-at-Arms lair,
read the Rights-of-Man.
O, maritime vile.

Look there: the colonizer stares
at broke barometer, sighs.

And fair, the ground does plunder where
dreadful riches were once.

Pull rank, the foreman’s chart is blank.
Its measure used to be read 
in maritime miles.

Uni Popular—
Can I be popular?
What does it really mean to be popular?
What if I told you I don’t wanna be popular?
I met this same person twice before.
They told of art school prophets far too cool to just ignore.
Where the old lines fall flat, you see,
their suburban parables were too arcane for a friend like me.
And now I see their double stumble in the streets by day.
And when I’m out on Brook I have to break it for the alley way.
Let be be final— 
I know it’s best this way.
But every time I bring you up it’s all in metaphor and sobriquet. 
Tell the truth.
And but we never even had the time to feign.
Too busy cussing Kissingers and thumbing Charlemagnes.
And when I came to find my love for one plussed two
affaire de coure just seemed to me like such a bogus move.
Tell the truth.
I know you.
What’s your problem? 
Just tell the truth.
12
I want to trust 
that you and I are good as us.
Of everyone
it’s got to be that I could not be billions.
But from your heart I cannot claim to will a part 
from it free port
and neither you nor I will chart nor guide consort.
To see to that we’re right, 
while the kids keep running aground, 
take what they like.
Amongst the skids,
below the draft is where I live.
From stern to dip
I bream with fire, graft, and forceful fingertip.
See, you and I, we’re right—
a problem in all the same ways 
but we know that’s trite.
This is your paradise. 
Lost in the paradise.
